"""
generates a bipartite matching using a approach similar to the Hopcroftâ€“Karp Algorithm

Args:
    verticesL (list): list of vertex names on the left side
    verticesR (list): list of vertex names on the right side
    edges (dict): dict with vertex names as keys and a list of vertices to which they are matched as values ((n:m)-mapping)

Returns:
    list: of tuples which are finally matched in a (1:1)-mapping
